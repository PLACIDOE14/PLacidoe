<p>"Hi, I'm Diane Erica Placido, a 21-year-old studying Information Technology at NU Fairview. I was born on December 14, 2002, under Sagittarius. I'm fascinated by the world of IT and am dedicated to learning more about it.
 
Having a supportive and loving family has been my anchor throughout my studies, pushing me to explore opportunities in this field.
 
Outside of academics, I find comfort in stargazing and moon gazing; it's my stress-relief and a way to connect with the wonders of the universe. Communicating with loved ones is also a priority, fostering meaningful connections that enrich my life.
 
Balancing work and play, I appreciate simple pleasures like connecting with friends, exploring new places, and savoring life's small wonders."</p>
